`apmz` enables shell script developers to instrument their scripts with [Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview), 
so you can trace events, measure script durations, duration of script functions, and catch script errors.
Best of all, this enables you to query, alert and build dashboards from this telemetry. 

## Install

Easiest way is to use golang, but there are also precompiled binaries on the [releases page](https://github.com/devigned/apmz/releases/).

```bash
$ go get github.com/devigned/apmz
...
$ apmz -h
...
```

## Usage

`apmz` offers a bunch of simple functionality to get you started quickly. First, you need to 
create an [Application Insights resource and fetch the instrumentation key](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-new-resource#copy-the-instrumentation-key).
Once you have created the resource and procured an instrumentation key, you can run the script below. 

__Be sure to add your key to the script or as an ENV var (INSTRUMENATION_KEY).__

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# put apmz in the path if it is not already
# this assumes ./bin directory holds the apmz binary
export PATH=./bin:$PATH

eval "$(apmz bash -n "myscript" -t "default=tag,something=cool" --api-keys "${INSTRUMENATION_KEYS}" )"
```

The script above evals a script generated by the `apmz bash` command. The script generated by 
`apmz bash` setups some env vars, functions and exit hooks to assist with instrumentation. Just by
executing the above script, there will be two events sent to Application Insights.
1) A trace event which contains the exit code of the script
2) A customMetric which contains the duration of the entire script

You should be able to view and query these traces and customMetrics via the [Log Query UI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/log-query/log-query-overview).

### Tracing and Time Metrics
With the basics of setting up a script handled, here's a script where we setup some tracing and
metrics of our own.

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# put apmz in the path if it is not already
# this assumes ./bin directory holds the apmz binary
export PATH=./bin:$PATH

# inject tracing helpers into the script naming the script "myscript" with default tags of
# "default=tag,something=cool" applied to all traces and metrics logging to the Application
# Insights resource identified by the INSTRUMENATION_KEY
eval "$(apmz bash -n "myscript" -t "default=tag,something=cool" --api-keys "${INSTRUMENATION_KEYS}" )"

# simple function to measure
sleep_for_a_second() {
  sleep 1
}

# log info customTrace a name and tags
trace_info "name-of-info-event" "tag1=foo,tag2=bar"

# log an error customTrace with a name and tags
trace_error "oh-no-an-error" "bang=crash"

# log the duration of the function sleep_for_a_second and log it as a custom metric
time_metric "my-metric-name" sleep_for_a_second

# script ends here and the helper exit hook takes the local logged events and sends them to 
# Application Insights
```

If you are interested in seeing more of what the script does just run `apmz bash` and you can see.

### What can I use with out eval'ing `apmz bash`
Well, you can do all of the things that `apmz bash` does, but you have to write your own functions.

```
$ apmz
apmz provides a command line interface for the Azure Application Insights

Usage:
  apmz [command]

Available Commands:
  bash        prints a bash script to source which provides functionality for common tracing and metrics operations
  batch       upload a batch of telemetry to Application Insights
  help        Help about any command
  metadata    Azure instance metadata service related commands
  metric      send a metric (customMetrics) to Application Insights
  time        time related commands
  trace       send a trace event (traces) to Application Insights
  uuid        generate a new uuid
  version     Print the git ref

Flags:
      --api-keys strings   comma separated keys for the Application Insights accounts to send to; eg 'key1,key2,key3'
      --config string    config file (default is $HOME/.pub.yaml)
  -h, --help             help for apmz
  -o, --output           instead of sending directly to Application Insights, output event to stdout as json

Use "apmz [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```
